            As a product delivered by a tea sommelier from a tea specialty shop,
            we have maximized the flavor of the tea leaves. We blend powdered
            multi-floral honey from Spain into the tea. The sweetness of the
            honey is so strong that there is no need to use sugar. Just one sip
            brings a feeling of happiness, a rich flavor. Itâ€™s a delicious tea,
            whether hot or iced, straight or as a milk tea.
